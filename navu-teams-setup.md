# Microsoft Teams + Navu

You can connect Navu Sidebar's live chat feature to a channel in your MS Teams instance. When someone wants to start a live chat in the sidebar, Navu will send a message in the Teams channel. This message will include the user's initial message and some metadata about the user. You can reply to that message in the channel. The thread created by this reply will mirror the chat the user sees on the sidebar. All their messages will appear in this thread. 

## Setting up Teams

**1.** Install the Navu app in your teams from the App Store **LINK GOES HERE**. When you add it to the team, it will ask you to select a channel. This is the channel where all live chats will happen.
