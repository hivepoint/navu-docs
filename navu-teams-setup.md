# Microsoft Teams + Navu

You can connect Navu Sidebar's live chat feature to a channel in your MS Teams instance. When someone wants to start a live chat in the sidebar, Navu will send a message in the Teams channel. This message will include the user's initial message and some metadata about the user. You can reply to that message in the channel. The thread created by this reply will mirror the chat the user sees on the sidebar. All their messages will appear in this thread. 

## Setting up Teams

1. Install the Navu app in your teams from the App Store **LINK GOES HERE**. When you add it to the team, it will ask you to select a channel. This is the channel where all live chats will happen. 

2. Go to your Navu portal, and open the Integrations page. You will see a section titled 'Microsoft'. Click the *Install* button. It will take you through Microsoft's OAuth flow. And you will end up back on the Integrations page. 

3. Click on '*Connect to a Channel*' button. It will list you your teams. Select the appropriate team, and the select the channel in that team where you installed the Navu app. Click *Connect*. Now your Navu site is connected to your Teams channel.
