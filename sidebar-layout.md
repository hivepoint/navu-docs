# Navu Sidebar

The sidebar is added to a page a web component `<navu-sidebar>`. It is automatically added as the last child of the `<body>` element. (Note:  If you want to customize how and where it is added to the page see **Custom Layout**.)

# Sidebar Layouts

The default sidebar comes with some standard layout CSS that allows the sidebar to function in three modes based on window widths. 

**Docked**: (width: 1200px and higher) positions the sidebar pinned to the right of the window. To allow this, the rest of the content on the page must be adjusted so the sidebar is not occluding the content. 

**Mobile**: (width: 650px and lower) makes the sidebar open like a modal dialog on top of your content. 

**Overlay**: For the widths in the middle.
